# TTS_epub_reader
A fairy bad implementation of an epub audiobook generator currently leverging AWS Polly as the "reader." BSD License, so steal away.

I am so sorry for how bad this code is...

Assumes you have your ~/.aws/credentials (or euqivalent) set up properly. For example, it should have the following structure:
[default]
aws_access_key_id=...
aws_secret_access_key=...
region=....
